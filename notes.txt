npm start get it running




There are two types of components
1. function component
2. class component - Use when state is being used because you need to change data.

STATE - data that can be changed
PROPS - data cannot be changed. This is preferred if you don't have to change data.

setState tells react it should re-render.
EXAMPLE

var Counter = React.createClass({
  propTypes:{},
  getInitialState: function(){
   return {
    score:0,
    }
  },
  decrementScore: function(e){
    this.setState({
    score: (this.state.score - 1),
  });
  },
  incrementScore: function(e){
    this.setState({
    score: (this.state.score + 1),
  });
  },

  render: function(){
   return (
    <div className="counter">
      <button className="counter-action decrement" onClick={this.decrementScore}> - </button>
      <div className="counter-score"> {this.state.score} </div>
      <button className="counter-action increment" onClick={this.incrementScore}> + </button>
    </div>
  );
 }});

 If you were to just do this.state.score += 1;
 It would not re-render.
